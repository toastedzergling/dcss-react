# dcss-react

An attempt to recreate the tournament scoring pages using Sequell's web api



# Goals

## Primary

Recreate the Scoring Pages for the .21 tournament
Recreate scoring graphs showing the value over time of each species/background/god
Create a UI for interesting Sequell Queries and outputting the results

## Stretch

Determine what was the single highest scoring game



# TODOs

xSpike that it's possible to communicate with the sequell API for listing games from a webpage and that CORS is cool
xRead the fetch documentation
Read and test each of the sequell list-commands
	Add the ability to run those commands from your page
Determine when the tournament began and ended and how to add that to !lg parameters
Read the tournament scoring page rules
	Examine the feasibility of ascertaining the scoring events using the web api
Figure out how to build this to be cross-browser compatible (run through babel/webpack/whatever)
